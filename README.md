#### WORK EXPERIENCE

<b>Idea GIC s.r.o. (Czech Republic)</b>

FilmClick (SaaS) - allows you to automate the work of a film crew at the stage of filming planning.

I was responsible to develop: 
- Page with movie scenes filming schedule. User can drag-and-drop scenes to calendar and sort their position to organize schedule. Every drag-and-drop operation makes API call and saves state of scenes schedule on server. Scenes can be filtered by many properties. Days of calendar can have properties like blocked, day off and etc.
- Page where user can create breaks in filming day schedule (Breaks are such as lunch, change of location and etc.) Saved by sending form data to server.
- Page where user can set status of actors in calendar (Statuses are such as available, no status, day off and etc.) Every status change saved on server with API call.

Tech stack: React, typescript, context, axios, styled-components, MUI, FontAwesome
